### PS Description :
<b>Background:</b> Event organizers lack real-time visibility into their ticket sales, audience demographics, and revenue streams, leading to inefficient marketing strategies and missed revenue opportunities. Many rely on static reports, third-party ticketing platforms, or spreadsheets, making it difficult to make data-driven decisions on the go.

<b>Common issues include:</b>
1) No live ticket sales tracking, leading to uncertainty about event demand.

2) Difficulty identifying marketing effectiveness, resulting in wasted ad spend.
   
3) Lack of insights into attendee demographics and purchase patterns.

4) Inability to react quickly to low sales trends, causing revenue loss.

<b>Objective:</b> To develop a mobile app (Android & iOS) that provides real-time ticket sales tracking, audience analytics, and actionable recommendations to event organizers.


<b>Summary:</b>
We developed a mobile-first application that empowers event organizers with real-time visibility into ticket sales, audience demographics, revenue streams, and marketing performance. The app addresses the common pain points of relying on static reports or third-party tools by offering live dashboards, sales tracking, and actionable insights on the go. This enables organizers to make data-driven decisions instantly, optimize ad spend, respond proactively to sales trends, and maximize event success.

### Objectives :
1. Easy Event Creation & Ticketing: Seamless interface to launch events and start selling tickets instantly.
2. Live Sales Tracking: Real-time monitoring of sales data with intuitive graphs and charts for quick analysis.
3. Event History & Analytics: Archived data of past events helps in understanding trends and planning future strategies.
4. Smart Recommendations: The app analyzes high and low-performing events to suggest actionable improvements.
5. Voice Assistant Integration: Built-in Gemini voice assistant allows hands-free, smooth interaction for quick queries and actions.
6. Emergency Alerts: Instant push notifications keep organizers informed about urgent or unexpected situations.
7. User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity and speed in mind to ensure a smooth experience for all users.

### Status :
We have implemented these features:
  1. User Login through Node, Mongo and Express.
  2. All features listed above were done by doing frontend using flutter, syncfusion and backend using MongoDB express.
  3. Recommender System Model was trained using weighted average and was integrated using Flask.
  4. In app voice based guide i.e gemini was integrated.
